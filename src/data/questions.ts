    question:
      "Although this man received 73 electoral votes, he would not become president; a situation which most directly led to the introduction of the 12th amendment. As vice president, he presided over the impeachment trail of Samuel P. Chase. Later in his political career, he was accused of treason for supposedly wanting to set up a monarchy in western North America. This man may be better known, though, for an incident that occured when he was running for governor of New York in 1804, where a federalist political opponent sullied his name with many slanders and eventually made him lose the election. This is what man who challenged Alexander Hamilton to a duel and killed him?",

Largely because of this measure, Russia was excluded from the peace negotiations at Versailles.

    question:
      "The most successful animal species, by this measure, is probably the Antarctic Krill, which accounts for 0.7% of the Earth's total for this measure. That estimate places them at five times the total for human beings, but only about a quarter that of crops. In aquatic systems, primary consumers often have more of this quantity than primary producers, because of the rapid turnover of phytoplankton. However, on land, the slower life cycles of plants mean that pyramids organized around this quantity are always widest at the base. Name this measure from ecology, whose units are typically given in mass per unit area.",

An early precocious work includes references to Donne and Hamlet, as well as an epigraph from Dante, while later poems like "Journey of the Magi" and "Ash Wednesday" reflect a turn towards religion.
