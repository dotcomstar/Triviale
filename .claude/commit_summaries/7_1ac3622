## Summary
Refactored Discord SDK initialization to gracefully handle non-Discord environments instead of throwing errors, enabling the app to run in both standalone and Discord Activity modes.

## Changes

### Initialization Flow Improvements
- Removed upfront check for Discord environment (ancestorOrigins check)
- Moved environment detection to Discord SDK's `ready()` method
- Changed missing Client ID from error to graceful degradation

### Error Handling
- Converted initialization failures from errors to informational logs
- Set `error` state to `null` when not in Discord (previously treated as error)
- Added friendly console messages distinguishing between Discord and standalone modes

### Logging Enhancements
- Added "Initializing Discord SDK..." log for visibility
- Enhanced success message with âœ… emoji and environment details
- Added logging of Discord context (channelId, guildId, instanceId)
- Changed error logs to informational logs for non-Discord environments

## Impact
- **Better UX**: App no longer shows errors when running outside Discord
- **Flexible deployment**: Same codebase works in both Discord and standalone web
- **Improved debugging**: Enhanced logging provides better visibility into initialization status
- **Graceful fallback**: Missing configuration or non-Discord environment handled elegantly
- Modified 17 lines, added 14 lines in `src/contexts/DiscordContext.tsx`
