## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Final Code Review
```bash
# Ensure you're on the correct branch
git branch

# Review uncommitted changes
git status

# Review recent commits
git log -5 --oneline
```

### Step 2: Build & Test Locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Build production bundle
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Step 3: Commit & Push
```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Discord Activity production release

- Optimized debug logging for production
- Cleaned up commented code
- Verified all features working
- Ready for production deployment"

# Push to remote
git push origin jaxonlee/discord_app
```

### Step 4: Merge to Main (or Deploy Branch)
```bash
# Option A: Create PR and merge via GitHub UI
# Option B: Merge locally
git checkout main
git merge jaxonlee/discord_app
git push origin main
```

### Step 5: Vercel Deployment
- [ ] Vercel automatically deploys `main` branch
- [ ] Check deployment status at https://vercel.com/dashboard
- [ ] Verify deployment succeeded (green checkmark)
- [ ] Visit production URL and test

### Step 6: Discord Activity Setup
- [ ] Update Activity URL in Discord Developer Portal
- [ ] Test Activity in Discord (use Developer Mode)
- [ ] Invite to test server
- [ ] Run through full game flow in Discord

### Step 7: Smoke Testing
Run quick smoke test in production:
- [ ] Load game in Discord Activity
- [ ] Login with Discord account
- [ ] Play one complete question
- [ ] Check stats dialog
- [ ] Verify localStorage persistence
- [ ] Check console for errors

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Authentication works
- [ ] Game is playable

### Short-Term Checks (First Hour)
- [ ] Monitor error rates in analytics
- [ ] Check user reports/feedback
- [ ] Verify stats persistence
- [ ] Test on multiple platforms

### Long-Term Monitoring (First Day)
- [ ] Daily question updates correctly
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] User engagement metrics look good

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are found in production:

### Quick Rollback (Vercel)
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments
2. Find last known good deployment
3. Click "..." ‚Üí "Promote to Production"
4. Production rolls back immediately

### Code Rollback (Git)
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD

# Or reset to specific commit
git reset --hard <commit-hash>

# Force push (use with caution!)
git push --force origin main
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Discord SDK fails to initialize
**Solution:** Check that `VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` matches Discord Developer Portal

### Issue: localStorage not working in Discord
**Solution:** Verify CSP compliance, ensure no third-party cookies blocked

### Issue: Questions don't load
**Solution:** Check daily index calculation, verify questions.ts has data

### Issue: Authentication fails
**Solution:** Verify OAuth2 redirect URIs match production URL exactly

### Issue: CSS/Styles broken
**Solution:** Clear browser cache, check MUI theme provider wraps app
